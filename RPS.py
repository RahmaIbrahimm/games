In this classic game, you'll be facing off against the computer in a battle of wits and quick decision-making. The rules are straightforward:

- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock

Here's how it works:
1. You and the computer will both choose one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The winner of each round is determined by the interactions between the choices: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
3. The game is played in a series of rounds, and the player with the most victories at the end is declared the overall winner.

To make your choice, simply type 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' when prompted. The computer will randomly select its choice, and the winner of each round will be announced.

Are you ready? Let the Rock, Paper, Scissors showdown begin!
